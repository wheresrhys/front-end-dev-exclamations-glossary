Front end developers verbal exclamations glossary
===================================

A glossary of meanings for exclamations sometimes heard coming from the mouths of developers

* **Ooosh/Boink** *[v]*  
Describes the experiences provided by fluid or jerky transitioms between breakpoints of a responsive layout

 > The consensus is it needs to be more *ooosh* than *boink*
* **Frr-rr-rr-rr-rr** *[v]*  
The process of iterating through an array using an as yet undefined, but presumably non-trivial, process

 > So we just get all the JSONs, pass them in and it just goes *frr-rr-rr-rr-rr* and it's done
